                    Welcome to the official documentation for Sprocket, a real-time server-side component library for Gleam! In this guide, we'll
                    cover the core concepts of Sprocket, but some prerequisite knowledge of Gleam is recommended. Gleam is a type-safe functional language designed
                    to harness the power of the Erlang Beam virtual machine. Whether you are a Gleam enthusiast or new to this exciting language,
                    this documentation will serve as your roadmap to building highly scalable, robust, and efficient server-side component views for your web application.

                  Based on a collection of proven functional patterns that empower developers to build real-time applications with ease,
                  Sprocket embraces the strengths of the Erlang Beam virtual machine's concurrency and fault-tolerance capabilities. It
                  offers an expressive and intuitive syntax, making it easier to reason about complex systems and craft maintainable code.

                  Sprocket attempts to bridge the gap between existing functional component libraries, type-safety, and real-time server renderd views.
                  The main goal is to enable developers to quickly construct server-side views without compromising on correctness guarantees or maintainability.
                  By leveraging the Erlang Beam VM, Sprocket enables high-throughput, fault-tolerant, and real-time server renderd applications that 
                  reduce the amount of code required to build web applications so you can focus on your business logic and ship faster.
