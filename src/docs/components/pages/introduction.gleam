                    Welcome to the official documentation for Sprocket, a real-time server-side component library for Gleam! In this guide, we'll
                    cover the core concepts of Sprocket, but some prerequisite knowledge of Gleam is recommended. Gleam is a type-safe functional language designed
                    to harness the power of the Erlang Beam virtual machine. Whether you are a Gleam enthusiast or new to this exciting language,
                    this documentation will serve as your roadmap to building highly scalable, robust, and efficient server-side component views for your web application.

                  Sprocket is designed around a collection of proven functional patterns that empower developers to build scalable applications with ease.
                  Embracing the strengths of the Erlang Beam virtual machine's concurrency and fault-tolerance capabilities enables developers to build
                  highly scalable and fault-tolerant applications that are easy to reason about and maintain.

                  The main goal of this library is to bridge the gap between existing functional component libraries, type-safety, and real-time server rendered
                  views so that developers can quickly construct applications without compromising on type guarantees. By leveraging the Erlang Beam VM,
                  Sprocket is built on a solid foundation that enables performant, scalable, and fault-tolerant applications.
